# CVF-Data-Analysis
This python program to created to analysis the sequencing results of a new developed COVID-19 full genome sequencing kit. 
The program will take the input NGS read conuts whihc are correlated with 96 different primer sets. 
The program will calculate and sort the absolute reading counts as well the relative reading count to determine the high efficiency primer sets and low efficiency primer sets. 
Figures of all primer sets efficiency in indivial organism ans in the whole testing batch will be generated as a visualization methods to assit further primer mixture balance or primer redeisgn.
